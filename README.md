# The DSA Roadmap 🚀

A systematic approach to mastering Data Structures and Algorithms, starting from core logic and moving toward complex problem-solving patterns.

## 📌 Phase 1: Logic Building (Current)
Before diving into complex structures, I am mastering **Nested Loops** and **Coordinate Logic** through pattern printing. This phase is dedicated to breaking AI dependency and improving manual "dry-running" skills.

### 🧩 Patterns Progress
- [x] Square Patterns (Constant values)
- [ ] Triangle Patterns (Variable row limits)
- [ ] Inverted Triangles
- [ ] Advanced Symmetrical Patterns

## 🏗️ Phase 2: Data Structures & Patterns (Upcoming)
Following the **NeetCode 150** / **Blind 75** roadmap.

| Topic | Key Technique | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Arrays & Hashing | Frequency Maps / Sets | ⏳ Pending |
| Two Pointers | Opposing/Converging | ⏳ Pending |
| Sliding Window | Dynamic Sub-arrays | ⏳ Pending |
| Stacks & Queues | LIFO/FIFO Logic | ⏳ Pending |

## 🛠️ The "Anti-AI" Workflow
To ensure true learning, I follow these rules:
1. **The Paper Trace:** Sketch the loop iterations on paper before coding.
2. **No-Copilot Zone:** Extensions are disabled during problem-solving.
3. **The 'Why' Test:** If I use a solution, I must explain the Time/Space complexity in the file comments.
